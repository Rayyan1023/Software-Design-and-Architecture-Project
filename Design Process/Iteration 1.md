# Iteration 1: Establishing an overall system structure
### Steps 2: Establish iteration goal by selecting drivers
Our iteration goal is to create an overall system structure that implements all our needs. Our drivers for this goal are:
- QA-2: Security
- QA-3: Usability
- QA-4: Performance, Testability
- CON-2: Website must be accessed on a web browser. The hardware does not matter (Desktop, Laptop, phone, etc.)
- CON-3: A relational database server that was already existing has to be used. The database should be the only thing being hosted on the server.
- CON-6: User transactions must be given with either credit or debit.
- CON-5: Backend of site must properly update UI with accurate information given by database server

### Step 3: Choose one or more elements of the system to refine
Because of the nature of our application. It is important to refine all of the FCAPS system with an emphasis on fault management, configuration management, performance management, and security management. Making sure all of these aspects of the system are as refined as they can be, allow the application to perform tasks at peak performance while also providing accurate fault detection, a secure network for user information, and accurate feedback on which users and what parts of the system are affected after configurations are made.

### Step 4: Choose one or more design concepts that satisfy the selected drivers

### Step 5: Instantiate architectural elements, allocate responsibilities, and define interfaces

### Step 6: Sketch views and record design decisions

### Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and achievement of design purpose
