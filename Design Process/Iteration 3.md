# Iteration 3: Addressing Quality Scenario Driver
## Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers
In this third Iteration, the architect focuses on the security quality scenario:
Malicious attempts to access and purchase through a user account. User account has two-step verification, and the user receives confirmation emails within 10 seconds, if email confirmation is not confirmed, transaction and account access is flagged.

## Step 3: Choose one or more Elements of the System to Refine
In this Security scenario, the Database Server, Application Server, Time Server and User Workstation are the physical node elements being used.

## Step 4: Choose one or more Design Concepts that Satisfy the Selected Drivers

## Step 7: Perform analysis of current design and review iteration goal and achievement of design purpose 
The status of the various drivers, as well as the decisions taken throughout the iteration, are summarised in the table below. The table has been cleared of drivers that were fully addressed in the previous edition.
